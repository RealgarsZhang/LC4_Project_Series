1.There may be some petty differences between my console or .trace output between the reference at the end. 
  Eg,for os.obj, I print one more line on console and write one more pair in .trace file.

2.Error messages for exceptions are all different. The messages of ref has spelling mistakes.

3.There are some debugging codes in all corners of my code, which of course have been commented.For example, print the state of the machine or print some control signals.
  Feel free to use them !^_^
